/**
 * The challenge of this exercise is for you to write production level code based on the scenario outlined in the Mockito-Part1 Slide 3.
 * You will have full control of service level definition, i.e. defining your own model, logic workflow, abstraction, interface.
 * The point of this exercise is not trying to have a black/white approach where the requirements have been predefined, i.e. EX1, EX2, EX3.
 * On the contrary, this exercise is designed for you to navigate code development via a TDD way, using mocking concepts.
 * For example, you may want to define an interface of what Identity API method look like, mock the response with your own Identity model.
 * You don't have to go from top to bottom which is illustrated from the sequence diagram. You can start with any service of your choice and work your way backward.
 * I hope you have fun, and unleash your imagination. Do think aloud and discuss options with your pairing partner if you follow the pair-programming practice.
 * Good luck!
